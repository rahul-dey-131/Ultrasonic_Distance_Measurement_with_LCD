# Ultrasonic_Distance_Measurement_with_LCD
This project uses an Arduino Uno and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of nearby objects and display it on a 16x2 LCD. If an object is too far, it shows “Seems safe...” on the screen. It’s a simple, practical setup ideal for obstacle detection or proximity alerts.
